*A list of all the Google Now voice commands*

You pick up your phone and say “OK Google”... and then what? 
Your phone is listening. 
The microphone icon is pulsing. 
What do you say to your phone? 
What can you say to it? 
Google Now’s voice function has become surprisingly robust over the years.

Here’s a list of just about everything you can say to Google Now. 
Try experimenting with different phrasing, 
you’ll be surprised how much it understands. 
The part of the phrase in [brackets] can be replaced with any similar term you choose.

If Google Now doesn’t get your spoken commands right, 
you can correct it by saying 
“No, I said...” and trying the phrase again.
