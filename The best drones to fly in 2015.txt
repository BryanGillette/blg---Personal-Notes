DJI Inspire 1 H500

DJI Inspire 1
DJI Inspire 1

Not content with having cornered the consumer drone market – and every news bulletin – with its amazing Phantom 2 Vision+, DJI has now launched a stunning mid-range drone aimed at prosumers. Like the Phantom, the new Inspire 1 is ready to fly straight out of the box using an iPad or Android tablet to monitor the action. The high-tech hand controller is a joy and equipped with ultra smooth joysticks and extra switches for controlling the quad's retractable carbon fibre prop arms and its new 360° 3-axis, modular gimbal. Naturally, it all comes pre-configured with DJI's trusted GPS technology and all the usual fail-safe modes, including auto take off and landing. It can even fly steadily indoors without GPS using its clever Optical Flow positioning sensor.

The Inspire 1's own-brand camera is equipped with a Sony 1/2.3-inch CMOS sensor and shoots 4K at 30fps and 1080p at up to 60fps with no GoPro-style fisheye to taint the view. It also takes excellent 12MP stills in JPEG or RAW. What's more, the camera and gimbal can also be operated by a second person using another hand controller; just like the pros do it. Expect around 20 minutes of flying time from the drone's intelligent 5700mAh 6S battery.

In the pantheon of camera-wielding UAVs, the Inspire 1 is an unequivocal winner. Think of it as the Audi R8 of drones: its gentle controls are perfectly dialled for smooth, rock steady videography but slam the stick forward and it shoots off at speeds in excess of 45 mph, twisting and turning like a dragonfly on steroids. Right now, this thing is matchless.

Walkera Tail

Walkera Tali
Walkera Tali H500

The Tali H500 has six blades instead of four so there's every chance you'll land it in one piece should a motor give up the ghost. It's also several inches bigger and more powerful than DJI's Phantom, and it comes with retractable landing gear so the camera's view isn't obscured by the legs.

The Tali H500 is superbly built. This isn't some shed-made Heath Robinson affair – it's a bona fide, factory-produced UAV equipped with a reliable set of pilot-aid components like GPS, return to home, even a fly around setting for circular flights. The 5400MAh battery delivers around 18 minutes of safe flying time. Like DJI's Inspire 1 and Phantom 2 Vision+, the Tali H500 comes out of the box ready to fly and is equipped with a 3-axis gimbal and Walkera's own iLook+ GoPro-style camera. Unfortunately, the camera might be the package's weakest link. It's no match for the GoPro or the Phantom camera, but it works seamlessly with the rest of the system, allowing pilots to control the camera and gimbal from the ground while viewing what the camera sees on the transmitter's small but decent colour monitor. Thankfully, the gimbal cage is just the right size to retro fit a GoPro, though you will need to spend an extra £100 or so on some video uplink components if you plan to fit one.

The Walkera's Devo 10 remote is one of its strongest facets. Aside from two gimbal controls, there are switches aplenty: one for retracting the landing gear, another for auto take off, another for GPS and manual modes and yet another for setting the circular flying mode. The flip-up colour monitor isn't iPad Mini standard but it's good enough for composing shots and seeing where you're going. If you're looking for a UAV that flies exceedingly well and doesn't look like a toy, then this is the one to go for. However, we advise you swap the iLook+ camera for a GoPro.

Parrot BeBop Drone

Parrot Bebop
Parrot Bebop Drone

When Parrot launched its camera-equipped AR Drone back in 2010, it inadvertently kick-started a whole new category of consumer electronics. Well here's another Parrot to add to the flight list. The lightweight, four-motor Parrot Bebop Drone is ready to soar out of the box and comes rammed to the hilt with an ample shedload of electronic wizardry that makes it both chimp-easy to control and extraordinarily stable in flight, especially when flown indoors.

Most current drones use a range of sensors and a GPS receiver to help keep them steady in flight, but this one appears to have the Full Monty, including an accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer and ultrasound. The HD camera-equipped Bebop is available in two packages. The basic kit is comprised of the drone and a pair of small LiPo batteries and you fly it using an Android or iOS tablet. The Bebop's free app provides full control of the drone by simply tilting the tablet screen in the direction you want it to fly. The app also includes camera controls, in-flight stats and a button for automatic take-offs and landings. The posher package adds another £340 to your spend but for that you get a damn decent hand remote which increases the Bebop's flight distance from a bogstandard 300 metres to around two kilometres. It's called the Skycontroller and we highly recommend it.

The Bebop eschews a camera-steadying gimbal in favour of a fixed fisheye lens and a cluster of complex algorithms that cleverly keep the image stable and allow the user to tilt the view up or down without the camera actually moving. The result is pretty steady video imagery with no barrel-like horizon distortion like that on the GoPro. However, it's a far from perfect solution as you can only tilt the camera down a certain degree; a proper motorised gimbal can usually tilt a full 90°. Image quality, too, is nowhere near as good as that of the GoPro or DJI's Phantom 2 Vision+. Nevertheless, if you're new to drones, not too discerning about video or picture quality and don't have enough cash for a Phantom, then by all means give this tough, well-built bird a whirl.

Hubsan X4

Hubsan X4
Hubsan X4

The palm-sized, ready-to-fly X4 is perfect for indoor flight, though it is very sensitive to control input which makes it quite tricky to fly, even with a 6-axis flight control system on board. Due to its diminutive size (just 70mm x 70mm) and consequent low weight, the X4 should only be flown outdoors in a light breeze. Anything stronger and the little fella may struggle to hold its position and may possibly even be taken with the wind. While this drone's fixed 0.3 megapixel camera can't compete with the Phantoms of this world, it's more than capable enough for casual consumer use. The camera shoots in 720p or 480p and recordings are saved to a microSD card on board the craft. However, as there is no screen to monitor what you're shooting, video and image results can be a bit hit and miss.

DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus

Phantom 2 Vision 
DJI Phantom 2 Vision+

Although it's been out the best part of a year, the ubiquitous Phantom 2 Vision+ is still one of the most stylishly presented RC flying camera packages on the market. It's superbly built and needs none of that Meccano-like construct-it-yourself malarkey required of some other brands. In fact, it's ready to fly straight out of the box. Simply spin the four props onto their respective spindles, bung four AA batteries into the transmitter, charge up the Phantom's snap-in Li-Ion battery, clip your iPhone to the transmitter and you're ready to go.

The Phantom 2 Vision+ comes equipped with a specially designed 14 megapixel GoPro-style camera mounted below the drone and integrated with a 3-axis gimbal that ensures smooth, rock steady video footage. The camera also transmits its field of view back to the iPhone, effectively turning the drone into a bona fide FPV (First Person View) aircraft. This bird is still the most popular drone on the market and justifiably so. It flies remarkably smoothly, is reliable in flight and is reasonably priced for a flying camera capable of nabbing video and stills from such amazing aerial perspectives.

Steadidrone Flare

Steadidrone Flare
Steadidrone Flare

The lesser-known, South African-produced Steadidrone Flare costs nearly £1,000 more than the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ but around £450 less than the DJI Inspire 1. However, it isn't anything like as integrated a package as the DJI models; for instance, you will still need to buy a monitor to view what the camera sees for FPV flying and aerial videography. Nevertheless, the Flare does have a few tantalising features up its sleeve. Firstly, it isn't camera specific so it can carry a variety of small cameras like the Sony RX100 and, of course, any model of GoPro.

Given that a delicate camera gimbal is usually the first thing to be destroyed in a crash, we like the fact that the camera on this drone is mounted up front, away from most of harm's way (unless, of course you fly straight into a building). You can also mount a GoPro in its protective underwater housing which adds extra peace of mind. But perhaps best of all is that the whole drone can be easily folded into a very tidy and portable package; a boon for anyone hiking out to suitably cinematic flying areas. The Flare is constructed almost entirely from carbon fibre and features the usual gamut of in-flight safety features – including the now obligatory GPS for steady, user-friendly flying.

Sky Hero Little Spy

Sky Hero
Sky Hero Little Spy

This UAV manufacturer has adopted a modular design system which is fantastic for avid modellers and those with a keen knowledge of UAV terminology but not so good for the casual consumer who just wants to fly straight out of the box. Nevertheless, being able to mix and match components can be considered a big bonus for those serious about their hobby. There are four main base models in the Spy Hero range – Spy, Spyder, Spyder 6 and Little Spyder – and each one can be upgraded at will. For instance, you might start with a basic Spy model and decide later on that you'd like it to have a bigger footprint and perhaps have it take a heavier payload. No problem, just order some longer carbon fibre arms, more powerful motors and a few extra components. Sky Hero is a highly respected manufacturer of top-quality UAVs, but it will need to start offering ready-to-fly models en masse if it really wants to compete with the likes of DJI, Walkera and Parrot.

Hubsan Q4

Hubsan Q4
Hubsan Q4

This nano quadcopter measures just 5cm x 5cm, which is roughly the size of a matchbox. It doesn't have a camera on board (that would be asking a little too much) but it flies exceptionally well given its tiny proportions. In fact, you can literally throw it in the air and, assuming you have some power on the stick, it'll level off and hover. True, the small hand controller requires extremely subtle input – a millimetre too much on the throttle stick and it's sure to clout the ceiling – but it's a great way to hone one's flying skills in preparation for something bigger. And, at just £30 a pop, it'll be no major loss if it ends up inside the dog.
